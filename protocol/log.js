/** The hash-chained input log and the once-per-player ledger signature.
 *
 *  BUILD-SPEC §6 (revised): per-tick signatures are withdrawn — verifying one
 *  per tick costs ~300× the replay. Instead every tick is chained, and each
 *  player signs the chain head once at match end. What that buys:
 *
 *   - the tick number is inside the chained entry, so a host cannot reorder,
 *     delay or drop an input without changing the head both players sign;
 *   - a player who disagrees with the host's log simply does not sign it —
 *     the delta then carries one signature and settles as disputed;
 *   - a witness verifies two signatures and one chain walk, then replays.
 *
 *  Entry shape: { k: tick, inputs: [frameSide0, frameSide1] }. Frames are
 *  whatever the title's step() consumes (Agent Fighter: bitfield ints). */
